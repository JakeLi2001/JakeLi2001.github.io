## About Me
I am a first-generation college student at CUNY Baruch College, Zicklin School of Business. I am currently a senior majoring in Computer Information Systems (Data Analytics Track) with a minor in Mathematics. I am very interested in data science because the ability to turn raw data into actionable insights that guide business decisions or solve a problem is truly fascinating and powerful.

Hobbies: Anime, tea, video games, guitar, music.
